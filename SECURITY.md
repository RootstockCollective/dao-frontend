# Reporting Security Issues

The RootstockCollective team and community take security vulnerabilities very seriously. Although this project is currently in its bootstrapping phase (MVP) and falls outside the scope of a Bug Bounty Program, we sincerely appreciate your responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.


## Responsible Disclosure

For all security related issues, use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/RootstockCollective/dao-frontend/security/advisories/new) tab.

The RootstockCollective team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/RootstockCollective/dao-frontend/issues).

## Vulnerability Handling

### Response Time

RootstockCollective will make a best effort to meet the following response times for reported vulnerabilities:

* Time to first response (from report submit) - 5 business days
* Time to triage (from report submit) - 7 business days

We'll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### Disclose Policy

* Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty.
