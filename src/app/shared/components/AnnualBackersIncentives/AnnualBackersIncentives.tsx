                  The Annual Backers Incentives (%) represents an estimate of the annualized percentage of
                  rewards that backers could receive based on their backing allocations.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The calculation follows the formula:
                  <span className="flex justify-center pt-4">
                    <ABIFormula />
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This estimation is dynamic and may vary based on total rewards and user activity. This data
                  is for informational purposes only.
